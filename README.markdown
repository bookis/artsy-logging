# Artsy

Create an application where a user can search for art using the [Artsy API](https://developers.artsy.net/start). You can choose the parameters to submit in the search as well as what to display with the response. Additionally, create a simple logging system to record what searches are being done, include:

- IP Address
- Search parameters
- Number of results
- Time in seconds to complete the request

The app should be a single page with the search and index. Rails is certainly overkill, but that's ok.
